# HOW to Custom Object Detection Using Tensorflow 2.11 (GPU) with Custom Training Dataset and Custom Models inside WINDOWS WSL, Conda Environment and Nvidia GPU


<!-- The Basics -->
## The Basics

This repository is a tutorial for how to use Tensorflow's Object Detection API (boxes Classsifier) to train an image into object detection classifier on Windows 11 Host. also when Tensorflow 2.11 is not support GPU inside Windows anymore, so we can use Ubuntu on Windows as our main host 


This README.md describes every step required to get going with your custom object detection classifier :

## About The Project

There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.
